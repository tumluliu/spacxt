# SpacXT Documentation

Welcome to the SpacXT documentation! SpacXT is a **Spatial Context Engine with Agentized Objects** - a revolutionary approach to 3D scene understanding through autonomous agent-based spatial reasoning.

## 📚 Documentation Index

- **[Overview](overview.md)** - What is SpacXT and why it matters
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** - System design and core concepts
- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** - Installation and first steps
- **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** - Detailed API documentation
- **[Examples](examples.md)** - Code examples and use cases
- **[Applications](applications.md)** - Real-world applications and future possibilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the interactive GUI demo
cd examples
poetry run python demo_gui.py

# Or run the command line demo
poetry run python demo.py
```

## 🎯 Core Concept

SpacXT transforms static 3D scenes into **living spatial intelligence systems** where objects are autonomous agents that:

- 🧠 **Reason** about their spatial context
- 💬 **Communicate** with nearby objects
- 🤝 **Negotiate** spatial relationships
- 📈 **Adapt** to changes dynamically

## 🌟 Key Innovation

Unlike traditional 3D engines where spatial relationships are hardcoded, SpacXT enables objects to **discover and maintain spatial understanding autonomously** through agent-based negotiation.
