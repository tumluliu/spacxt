# Spatial Context & Q&A System

## Overview

SpacXT's **Spatial Context & Q&A System** represents a breakthrough in space-aware artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional systems that treat spatial relationships as external metadata, SpacXT makes spatial context **intrinsic** to the scene representation, enabling emergent spatial intelligence and sophisticated question-answering capabilities.

## 🏗️ Spatial Context Architecture

### Multi-Layered Spatial Representation

The spatial context is built from multiple interconnected layers:

```python
{
    "scene_summary": {
        "total_objects": 7,
        "object_types": ["book", "cup", "table", "stove", "chair", "lamp"],
        "relationship_types": ["in", "on_top_of", "supports", "near", "beside"],
        "scene_bounds": {"x": (0.7, 3.9), "y": (0.9, 1.9), "z": (0.0, 1.2)}
    },

    "objects": {
        "coffee_cup_1": {
            "class": "cup",
            "position": (1.30, 1.50, 1.15),
            "size": [0.08, 0.08, 0.1],
            "affordances": ["hold_liquid", "portable"],
            "level_of_mobility": "high",
            "confidence": 0.95
        }
    },

    "relationships": [
        {
            "type": "on_top_of",
            "subject": "coffee_cup_1",
            "object": "table_1",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "properties": {"height_diff": 0.77}
        }
    ],

    "support_dependencies": {
        "dependents": {"table_1": ["coffee_cup_1", "coffee_cup_2", "book_1"]},
        "scene_analysis": {"supported_objects": 3, "ground_objects": 4}
    },

    "spatial_clusters": [
        {
            "cluster_type": "table_group",
            "objects": ["table_1", "coffee_cup_1", "coffee_cup_2"],
            "center_object": "table_1"
        }
    ],

    "accessibility": {
        "reachable_objects": [...],
        "accessibility_scores": {...}
    },

    "stability": {
        "support_chains": [...],
        "stable_structures": [...]
    }
}
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Object Representation**
Each object contains rich spatial and semantic information:
- **Position & Size**: 3D coordinates and bounding box
- **Affordances**: What the object can do (`support`, `hold_liquid`, `illuminate`)
- **Level of Mobility**: `fixed`, `low`, `medium`, `high`
- **Confidence**: Certainty of object detection/classification

#### 2. **Spatial Relationships**
Seven types of spatial relationships are automatically detected:

| Relationship | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `on_top_of` | Object A sits on surface of object B | Cup on table |
| `supports` | Object A provides structural support for B | Table supports cup |
| `near/far` | Distance-based proximity | Chair near table |
| `beside` | Objects at similar height, close in 2D | Books beside each other |
| `above/below` | Vertical relationships without contact | Lamp above floor |
| `in` | Containment relationships | Objects in room |
| `custom` | LLM-calculated complex spatial descriptions | Between, corner, etc. |

#### 3. **Support Dependency System**
Tracks structural dependencies and cascade effects:

```python
# Support relationships
support_relationships = {
    "coffee_cup_1": "table_1",    # cup1 supported by table
    "coffee_cup_2": "table_1",    # cup2 supported by table
    "book_1": "table_1"           # book supported by table
}

# Dependency mapping
dependents = {
    "table_1": {"coffee_cup_1", "coffee_cup_2", "book_1"}
}
```

#### 4. **Spatial Clustering**
Automatically identifies functional regions:
- **Table Group**: Objects clustered around tables
- **Cooking Area**: Objects near stoves/ovens
- **Object Group**: General proximity clusters

#### 5. **Accessibility Analysis**
Evaluates object reachability:
- **Reachable Objects**: Easily accessible (score > 0.7)
- **Blocked Objects**: Limited accessibility (score < 0.3)
- **Accessibility Scores**: Based on mobility, support, and obstruction

#### 6. **Stability Analysis**
Assesses structural integrity:
- **Stable Structures**: Ground-level, self-supporting objects
- **Support Chains**: Dependencies between objects
- **Stability Risk**: Low/medium/high based on dependency depth

## 🤔 Space-Aware Q&A System

### Question Classification

The system intelligently routes questions to specialized handlers:

```python
def _classify_question(self, question: str) -> str:
    """Classify spatial questions into 7 categories"""

    # Relationship questions
    if any(word in question for word in ["relationship", "on", "support"]):
        return "relationship"

    # Location questions
    elif any(word in question for word in ["where", "location", "find"]):
        return "location"

    # Accessibility questions
    elif any(word in question for word in ["reach", "access", "blocked"]):
        return "accessibility"

    # Stability questions
    elif any(word in question for word in ["stable", "fall", "collapse"]):
        return "stability"

    # What-if questions
    elif any(word in question for word in ["what if", "happen", "remove"]):
        return "what_if"

    # Complex reasoning (LLM-powered)
    elif any(word in question for word in ["why", "how", "explain"]):
        return "complex"

    else:
        return "general"
```

### Question Types & Examples

#### 1. **Relationship Questions**
Queries about spatial connections between objects.

**Example:**
```
Q: "What objects are on the table?"
A: Found these spatial relationships:
• coffee_cup_1 (cup) on_top_of table_1 (table) [confidence: 0.95]
• coffee_cup_2 (cup) on_top_of table_1 (table) [confidence: 0.95]
• book_1 (book) on_top_of table_1 (table) [confidence: 0.94]
```

#### 2. **Location Questions**
Queries about object positions and spatial distribution.

**Example:**
```
Q: "Where are all the cups in the scene?"
A: Object locations:
• coffee_cup_1 (cup) is at position (1.30, 1.50, 1.15)
  - Part of table_group with 5 objects
• coffee_cup_2 (cup) is at position (1.70, 1.50, 1.15)
  - Part of table_group with 5 objects
```

#### 3. **Accessibility Questions**
Queries about object reachability and interaction potential.

**Example:**
```
Q: "Which objects can I easily reach?"
A: Accessibility analysis:
• 4 objects are easily reachable:
  - chair_12 (chair) [accessibility: 1.00]
  - coffee_cup_1 (cup) [accessibility: 1.00]
  - coffee_cup_2 (cup) [accessibility: 1.00]
  - book_1 (book) [accessibility: 1.00]
```

#### 4. **Stability Questions**
Queries about structural integrity and support relationships.

**Example:**
```
Q: "What objects would fall if I remove the table?"
A: If table_1 is removed:
• 3 objects would fall due to gravity:
  - coffee_cup_1 (cup)
  - coffee_cup_2 (cup)
  - book_1 (book)
```

#### 5. **What-If Questions**
Hypothetical scenarios with predictive analysis.

**Example:**
```
Q: "What if I remove the table?"
A: Hypothetical analysis:
If table_1 is removed:
• 3 objects would fall due to gravity:
  - coffee_cup_1 (cup)
  - coffee_cup_2 (cup)
  - book_1 (book)
```

#### 6. **Complex Questions (LLM-Powered)**
Advanced reasoning requiring contextual understanding.

**Example:**
```
Q: "Why are the cups positioned where they are?"
A: The cups are positioned on the table because:
• Table provides stable support surface at optimal height
• Central table location makes cups accessible from multiple directions
• Positioning follows typical kitchen organization patterns
• Spatial clustering creates functional work area
```

#### 7. **General Questions**
Overview queries about scene characteristics.

**Example:**
```
Q: "Tell me about the overall scene layout"
A: Scene Overview:
• Total objects: 7
• Object types: book, cup, table, stove, chair, lamp
• Relationship types: in, on_top_of, supports, near
• Scene bounds: X(0.7, 3.9), Y(0.9, 1.9), Z(0.0, 1.2)

Key Insights:
• Scene has 3 stacking relationships
• 3 objects depend on others for support
• 1 objects are fixed in place
```

## 🚀 Real-World Applications

### Smart Home Automation

**Safety Monitoring:**
```
Q: "Is it safe to turn on the stove?"
A: Stability analysis shows lamp_1 is 0.6m from stove with no obstructions.
   No flammable objects detected in cooking area. Safe to activate.
```

**Context-Aware Control:**
```
Q: "Turn off lights in areas where no one is sitting"
A: Accessibility analysis shows chair_12 is unoccupied (no objects indicating use).
   Turning off lamp_1 in cooking area. Table area remains lit (active workspace detected).
```

### Robotics & Automation

**Path Planning:**
```
Q: "How should I approach the cup on the table?"
A: coffee_cup_1 is accessible from 3 directions. Recommended approach:
   from chair_12 side (0.4m clearance) to avoid collision with book_1.
```

**Task Planning:**
```
Q: "What's the best order to clear the table?"
A: Recommended sequence based on support dependencies:
   1. Remove coffee_cup_1 and coffee_cup_2 (no dependencies)
   2. Remove book_1 (no dependencies)
   3. Table can now be safely moved/cleaned
```

### Industrial & Safety Applications

**Structural Analysis:**
```
Q: "What would happen if this support beam is removed?"
A: Support analysis shows 12 objects depend on beam_A. Removal would cause
   cascade failure affecting critical equipment in zones 3-7.
   Recommended: Install temporary supports before removal.
```

**Workspace Optimization:**
```
Q: "How can we improve accessibility in this workspace?"
A: Accessibility analysis identifies 3 blocked objects. Recommendations:
   • Move heavy equipment from high-traffic areas
   • Create clear pathways to frequently accessed items
   • Relocate fixed objects to perimeter positions
```
