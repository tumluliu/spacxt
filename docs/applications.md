# SpacXT Applications & Use Cases

## ü§ñ Robotics & Autonomous Systems

### **Intelligent Navigation**
SpacXT enables robots to understand spatial context through agent negotiation:

```python
# Robot queries spatial relationships
robot.query("Find objects near the kitchen counter")
# ‚Üí Returns dynamically discovered spatial relationships

# Path planning with spatial awareness
path = robot.plan_path(
    start="living_room",
    goal="kitchen",
    avoid_near=["fragile_objects"]
)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Dynamic obstacle avoidance** based on discovered relationships
- **Context-aware navigation** that adapts to environmental changes
- **Collaborative spatial understanding** between multiple robots

### **Manipulation Planning**
Objects negotiate their spatial relationships to assist robot manipulation:

```python
# Objects self-organize for optimal manipulation
cup_agent.propose_relationship("stackable_on", plate_agent)
plate_agent.negotiate_support_capability(cup_agent)

# Robot uses negotiated relationships
robot.pick_and_place(
    object="cup",
    target="plate",
    relationship="on_top_of"
)
```

### **Multi-Robot Coordination**
Robots share spatial understanding through distributed agent networks:

```python
# Robot A discovers spatial relationship
robot_a.agents.chair.discover_relationship("near", table)

# Relationship propagates to Robot B's spatial model
robot_b.sync_spatial_context(robot_a.scene_graph)
```
